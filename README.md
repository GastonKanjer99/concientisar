## 🔬 Through the Radar Looking Glass: Revealing Earth Processes with SAR  

### 📖 Summary  
Like *Alice in Wonderland*, we invite you to travel down the rabbit hole to reveal a world that looks like Earth… but not quite.  

Using **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)**, we can capture images of our planet by emitting radar pulses and recording the energy reflected after interacting with Earth’s surface.  

Our goal is to download and analyze **multi-frequency** or **multi-polarization SAR data** for a chosen study area – e.g., tropical wetlands, glaciers, wildfire zones, flooded neighborhoods, volcanic eruptions – and develop **hypotheses about the physical drivers** shaping those environments.

### 🎬 Background  
- [▶️ Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ__KsJRLHo)  
- SAR allows us to:  
  - Penetrate clouds and darkness.  
  - Detect subtle changes on Earth’s surface.  
  - Provide critical insights for environmental monitoring and disaster response.

## 🛠️ Methodology  
1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Select a study area of interest.  
   - Obtain SAR datasets from public sources (NASA, ESA, or others).  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Apply noise reduction, calibration, and georeferencing.  

3. **Analysis**  
   - Compare multi-frequency / multi-polarization data.  
   - Identify patterns related to vegetation, water, soil, or geological processes.  

4. **Hypothesis Generation**  
   - Interpret the SAR signals in terms of real-world physical processes.
